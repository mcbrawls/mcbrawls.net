## How do I play?

Join MC Brawls on `play.mcbrawls.net`! Brawls should always support the latest version of Minecraft.

Then hop on, find a game kiosk or use `/queue` to play!

## Can you make \<MC Championship GAME>?

No.

As epic as remaking MC Championship would be, Brawls should be its own identity.

There are plenty of MCC remakes out there to satisfy anyone wanting that, though!

MCC Island will slowly be rolling out their games also, so eventually any hard work put in to recreate the games would result to nothing.

*I would also love to avoid a cease and desist from noxcrew x*

## How can I support the server?

Grab some friends and play! Getting more people to play Brawls and have fun is the best way to support the server and keep it alive.

If you'd like to fund the server's upkeep, consider subscribing to Brawls+ over on our [webstore](https://store.mcbrawls.net). You can purchase it as a one-time payment or on a monthly basis, and it's only Â£2.99!

## How do I report issues?

You can report issues through our [official issues page](https://github.com/mcbrawls/brawls-issues/issues).

## Can I record/stream Brawls?

Please do! 100%! I encourage it! Grab your friends and have a fun time.

## Can I spectate someone's game?

Yep, and it's easy! Just use `/spectate <player>` and you'll be pulled into that player's game to spectate.

## Can I use Brawls to host tournaments/minis?

Absolutely! You can use `/duel` to create personal games between 2 parties.

Partners and staff can also create 'game events', which involve custom teams much like MC Championship.

## Can I partner with MC Brawls?

Our partnership program is currently closed, but is being reworked and will open again for new applicants.
