## Changes

- Made the Teleshovel not be removed on capture collect when you are the only member of your team in Rise: Capture

## Fixes

- Fixed spectators being factored into Rise: Capture point checks
- Fixed Rise: Capture participants being teleported to the center on rejoin
- Fixed queues so that joining a queue earlier now prioritises you for game assignment
    - Meaning players who joined the queue first should be queued first
- Fixed players being teleported back to their spawns when the game is won in Rise: Capture
- Fixed being able to move equipped boots around your inventory in relevant game modes
