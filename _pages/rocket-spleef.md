# Overview

**Rocket Spleef** is a game is made up of **5 to 12 players**, each with an **Elytra** and **Rocket Launcher**.

Players fight in **3-minute rounds** to be the last player standing! Experience is granted based on your placement at the end of the round.

Players start above the map and are dropped in when a round begins. **You are eliminated if you fall below the map** - keep on the platforms to stay in the game!

# <i class="fas fa-rocket"></i> Rocket Launcher

Your tool in the game is the **Rocket Launcher**. It can hold **up to 3 rockets at once**, which **automatically reload** over time when you stop firing. Rockets reload faster when you are on the ground, but still reload when in air.

Launched rockets travel extremely fast in the direction you fire and **explode on impact**! These explosions can be used to **destroy the map, knock other players away, or boost yourself while flying**.

There is a very short cooldown between each rocket fire, so you can't spam all three at once!

The current status of your Rocket Launcher is shown at the bottom of the screen, just above your hotbar. You can see **your rocket count and reload status**.

Your rocket fire cooldown is displayed over the Rocket Launcher item in your inventory.

# <i class="fas fa-bacteria"></i> Mutators

A Rocket Spleef round can mutate! A Mutator has an effect on the rhythm of the game, changing how you play. Mutators may be destructive, fun or even helpful!

The first mutation happens **30 seconds** after the game starts, and there is the same cooldown at the end of each mutation.

## <i class="fas fa-meteor"></i> Meteor Strike

TNT is falling from the sky and **exploding on impact**. These behave the same way as rocket explosions, so **dodge them or use them to your advantage**!

## <i class="fas fa-arrow-up-wide-short"></i> Quick Fire

Your rocket count is reset to 10! There is no cooldown on your additional rockets, so fire as fast as you can to your advantage! The mutator ends after 10 seconds or when everyone uses their extra rockets, at which your rockets are reset to normal.

## <i class="fas fa-dove"></i> Levitate

Everyone has levitation! Your elytra flight is paused as you float up, which may save you from the void.

## <i class="fas fa-eye-slash"></i> Blindfold

Everyone has darkness! Your visibility is hindered, so you need to be careful where you're flying and who you're near.

## <i class="fas fa-ghost"></i> Ghosted

Everyone is invisible! Where is everyone? I don't know!

## <i class="fas fa-feather-pointed"></i> Low Gravity

Everyone has slow falling. Target other players or use the effect to save yourself from a sticky situation!

## <i class="fas fa-icicles"></i> Freeze Out

Patches of ice spawn around the map, making the map slippier!

# Last Stand

At the 45 second mark, or when there are only 2 players left, the game will enter the Last Stand.

The cooldown between mutators is removed, causing chaos in an attempt to eliminate the last players!
