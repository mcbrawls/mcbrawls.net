## <i class="fas fa-person-walking-luggage"></i> Rise: Capture

Introducing **Rise: Capture**, an exhilarating new addition to Brawls! Get your teammates together and prepare for chaos.

Fight for control over the center point while dodging hazards! Powder rains down from above, and the floor is deadly. Use your trusty **Teleshovel** to gather Powder and create a safe path across the floor. But be quick - it's a race to collect and secure the point for your team. The first to claim **3 monuments** emerges victorious!

## <i class="fas fa-snowflake"></i> Spleef

We're bringing back a **classic** with a frosty twist! **Spleef** has officially joined the MC Brawls roster of games. 

The rules are simple but the competition is fierce! Destroy blocks under your opponents to send them tumbling into the void. Be the last player standing on the platform to claim victory.
