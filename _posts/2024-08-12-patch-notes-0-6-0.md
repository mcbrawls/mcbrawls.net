Patch 0.6.0 has made its way to MC Brawls after a year of development, bringing a brand new game: **ROCKET SPLEEF!**

## <i class="fas fa-rocket"></i> Rocket Spleef

Rocket Spleef is a game is made up of 5 to 12 players, each with an Elytra and Rocket Launcher.

Players fight in 3-minute rounds to be the last player standing! Experience is granted based on your placement at the end of the round.

Players start above the map and are dropped in when a round begins. You are eliminated if you fall below the map - keep on the platforms to stay in the game!

See more information for Rocket Spleef on [its dedicated page](/rocket-spleef).

## <i class="fas fa-compass"></i> Hub Menus

You now have access to menus from the hub, instead of needing to just know queue commands!

There are also widgets for your [profile](#profile), [friends](#-friends), parties, and chat mode toggling!

### Navigator Compass

The new navigator compass! Browse all the games and queue up! You can also now choose to queue a random game.

### Profiles

You can view a bunch of player information in new player profiles!

## <i class="fas fa-user-group"></i> Friends

Friends exist already but don't mean much, so we're changing that! With the addition of the friends menu, you can manage your friends and friend requests, showing player profiles and clickable options to party up members.

We’ve also revamped the ignoring system with this part of the update, which is now integrated better into the chat system. You will get better and more relevant feedback if you cannot message someone. You can now view your ignored players through the ignore command or as a sub-menu of the friends GUI.

## <i class="fas fa-chart-simple"></i> Leaderboards

Who needs websites when you can have HOLOGRAMS?! Now filling the hub are leaderboard displays.

![Leaderboards](/img/leaderboards-orthographic.png)

Current leaderboards are:

- Total Experience
- Rockets Fired
- Dodgebolt Rounds Won
- Rise Powder Floors Survived
- Dodgebolt Arrow Hit Ratio (Shots Hit / Shots Fired)

More will come!

## Something missing?

Not everything mentioned within previous blog posts is in the update, but if it has been mentioned on the website then it will show up at some point!

Watch out for future updates (a lot sooner!) to fill in the gaps.

Look forward to:
