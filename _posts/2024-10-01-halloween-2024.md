## <i class="fas fa-ghost"></i> Limited Edition Halloween Titles!

For a *limited time* only, you can grab two exclusive, Halloween-themed titles! These are **only available** for the duration of the event, so don't miss out on snagging them before they're gone. Become the ultimate spooky champion with these cool new titles:

- Frankenbrawler
- Reaper

Get your hands on these titles before they're locked away forever. [Head over to the store now!](https://store.mcbrawls.net/category/halloween-2024)

## <i class="fas fa-house"></i> Hub

The hub has been **completely transformed** for Halloween! Pumpkins, haunting pastures, and eerie decorations fill every corner. Wander through the revamped hub and take in all the Halloween spirit.  
Oh, and by the way, the pesky issue of players messing around with trapdoors? *That's gone.* No more random trapdoor flicking!

The **leaderboards building** also got a bit of an upgrade—there’s now a second floor, making it easier than ever to check out who's on top. Step in, take a look around, and maybe even plot how you're going to dethrone the top players!

## <i class="fas fa-rocket"></i> Rocket Spleef

Get ready for some aerial action with a brand-new Rocket Spleef map: **Doughnut**! This latest addition brings a fresh layout to keep you on your toes.

## <i class="fas fa-screwdriver-wrench"></i> Fixes

We've squashed some long-standing bugs to keep the gameplay smoother than ever:

- **Dodgebolt loading times** are finally fixed! Believe it or not, one sneaky line of code had been slowing down map loads by nearly 4.8x. That’s been handled, so get back to brawling without the annoying wait!

- **Player list columns** are now properly organized when 10+ players are online. No more awkward lists where players spill all over the screen in one messy column. It’s all tidy and easy to read now!

Happy Brawling, and have a spooky, fun-filled Halloween event!
