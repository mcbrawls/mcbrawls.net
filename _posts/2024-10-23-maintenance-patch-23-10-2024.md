Hello, I hope you guys are enjoying the Halloween event! We've got a decently-sized major release for you guys. No new games just yet, but you can expect those as a festive present...

Speaking of presents... have 60% Off Halloween titles for checking this out! Use coupon [`VX2K-Z9D8-4PJC`](https://store.mcbrawls.net/category/halloween-2024) at checkout.

## Objectives HUD

There's a small new HUD displayed at the start of our original Brawls games, displaying the base objectives of the game. This is pretty basic for now, and can be disabled in your settings if you'd rather not see it.

## Other Changes

We've added a few more settings! You can now disable the event pop-up HUD, that being the experience display when you score in Rocket Spleef or Rise. You can also turn off your Brawls+ badge, if you are subscribed.

Game event chat messages have had a fix too, they now respect custom teams! Sorry this stuck around for so long. Dodgebolt events also now take place in a night setting.

## What next?

Hmm, what do we have next in store for Brawls? Here's a few things planned:

- **Game Event Spectating:** hopping into a game event as a spectator before the game begins
- **Medals**
- **New Games!**

See you later, Happy Brawling!
