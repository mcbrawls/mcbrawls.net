# Gameplay

Cheating in any form is not allowed; this includes client modifications and exploits involving modifying behaviour outside the game to give yourself an unfair advantage.

# Chat Policy

Our chat policy applies to any space in MC Brawls which allows communication between players. These rules do not apply on the Minecraft server in party chats, as these are unmoderated spaces and the responsibility of the party leader to kick players who are not following party rules.

1. We have a **zero tolerance policy** for any homophobia, racism, bigotry or similar.
2. Do not advertise or do any kind of self promotion¹.
3. Do not flood the chat by spamming messages.
4. Let's be nice to each other. Toxicity is not allowed.
5. Use common sense. These rules should not be a legal document, please help it keep that way.
6. Please do not discuss punishments in public chat. To appeal, you can create a ticket on our [Discord server.](https://discord.mcbrawls.net)

¹ The `#advertising` channel on our discord server is an exception.

# Punishments

If the rules of MC Brawls on any platform are broken, you can expect to face a relevant punishment for your action.

## Punishment Evasion

If you avoid a punishment by using a different account, the alternative account used will receive a permanent punishment and the original account will receive a warning on its record. For example, if ban evading then the alt will receive a permanent ban and the original account will receive a warning for evasion.

Evading punishments for alternate accounts are permanent and will not be lifted.

# Reports

You can report a player on our [Discord](https://discord.mcbrawls.net) or through `/report` directly on the Minecraft server.
