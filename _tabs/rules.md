*Work in progress.*

## Punishments

If the rules of MC Brawls on any platform are broken, you can expect to face a relevant punishment for your action.

### Punishment Evasion

If you avoid a punishment by using a different account, the alternative account used will receive a permanent punishment and the original account will receive a warning on its record. For example, if ban evading then the alt will receive a permanent ban and the original account will receive a warning for evasion.

Evading punishments for alternate accounts are permanent and will not be lifted.

## Reports

You can report a player on our [Discord](https://discord.mcbrawls.net) or through `/report` directly on the Minecraft server.
