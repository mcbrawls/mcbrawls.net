Hi everyone! Here's an update for partners following the 0.6.0 update.

- Added `/game-event`, usable by partners


- Given all registered partners the partner role on the Minecraft server
    - Name icon and colour! It looks really pretty, check it out


- Dodgebolt events have been renamed to game events
- Game events now have a waiting room which players are teleported to, instead of using the hub
- It is a known issue that players cannot spectate a game event yet until the game initialises, this will be fixed

Game Event Command Syntax:  
`/game-event <game type> <alpha party leader> <alpha team> <beta party leader> <beta team>`

The partnership program is still closed but will be reopening at some point.

Happy Brawling! ⚔️
