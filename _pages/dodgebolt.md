# Overview

In this best-of-5 finale, the top two teams need to eliminate the entire opposing team to win each round!

Both teams start across from each other on opposite sides of an arena and must try to eliminate each other using 1-shot-kill arrows.

There are only ever 2 arrows in play and the arena shrinks as the game progresses, so be careful not to fall.
