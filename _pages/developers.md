Hello developers! If you're interested in how Brawls works, let's have a chat.

# Framework

Brawls runs [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) underneath. This may seem crazy... *because it is*.

There are a few reasons why I choose to use Fabric:

1. **It's extremely malleable:** using Fabric is only a step or two away from just modifying the game's code.
2. **I've used Fabric for years:** I have a lot of experience with Fabric, in my making of many Minecraft mods in the past.
3. **We're in too deep:** the Brawls codebase is massive now, and it would be extremely difficult to switch to anything else.

# Requests

If you'd like me to go into detail about anything regarding Brawls development, **that's what this page is for**!
