## ðŸ›¡ Reporting GUI

The next update will move player reporting in-game. You will now be able to make a report with `/report <player> <reason>`.
This brings up a lovely GUI which allows you to preview the report (in the same way that moderators will view it) before it is sent.

## â„¹ New HUDs

## ðŸ“š Libraries (for Developers)

Over the course of this update, we've migrated a load of code to separated libraries and made them open source.
For any developers, here's a list of them:

- [Blueprint](https://github.com/mcbrawls/blueprint): manages saving/loading structures (world maps, etc)
- [Pack Manager](https://github.com/mcbrawls/packmanager): manages resource packs within the server/world scopes (per world resource packs)
- [Bubble](https://github.com/mcbrawls/bubble): runtime worlds (existed before this update, it's just nice to mention)
- [Audience](https://github.com/mcbrawls/audience): allows you to perform functions on various player containers, such as worlds
- [Scheduler](https://github.com/mcbrawls/scheduler): provides useful scheduling classes, works with Minecraft ticks
