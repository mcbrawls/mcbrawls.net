# â„¹ Overview

**Rocket Spleef** is a game is made up of **5 to 8 players**, each with an **Elytra** and **Rocket Launcher**.

Players fight in **3-minute rounds** to be the last player standing! Experience is granted based on your placement at the end of the round.

Players start above the map and are dropped in when a round begins. **You are eliminated if you fall below the map** - keep on the platforms to stay in the game!

# ðŸš€ Rocket Launcher

Your tool in the game is the **Rocket Launcher**. It can hold **up to 3 rockets at once**, which **automatically reload** over time when you stop firing.

Launched rockets travel extremely fast in the direction you fire and **explode on impact**! These explosions can be used to **destroy the map, knock other players away, or boost yourself while flying**.

There is a very short cooldown between each rocket fire, so you can't spam all three at once!

The current status of your Rocket Launcher is shown at the bottom of the screen, just above your hotbar. You can see **your rocket count and reload status**.

Your rocket cooldown is also displayed over the Rocket Launcher item.

# ðŸ¦  Mutators

A Rocket Spleef round can mutate! A Mutator has an effect on the rhythm of the game, changing how you play. Mutators may be destructive, fun or even helpful!

The first mutation happens **15 seconds** after the game starts, and there is the same cooldown at the end of each mutation.

## Meteor Strike Mutator

TNT is falling from the sky and **exploding on impact**. These behave the same way as rocket explosions, so **dodge them or use them to your advantage**!
