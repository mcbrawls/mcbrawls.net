# Overview

**Spleef** is a Minecraft classic, made up of **5 to 10 players**, each armed with an **Instamine Shovel**.

Players fight in **3-minute rounds** to be the last player standing! Experience is granted based on your placement at the end of the round.

You receive credit for spleefing other players, so make an effort to eliminate your opponents!

Breaking blocks gives you snowballs which can be thrown to knock other players.

Players start above the map and are dropped in when a round begins. **You are eliminated if you fall below the map** - keep on the platforms to stay in the game!
