We've been doing a lot since the last post! We have a couple of big features to showcase here.

## 🫂 Friends & Ignoring GUIs

The friends system isn't too useful in Brawls at the moment. It's a list of players each player has that just sort of sits there. Let's change that!

In the next update, we will be introducing the friends GUI! This is one of the many interfaces on their way to Brawls. This GUI allows you to view and manage your friends list, showing player profiles and clickable options to party up members.

We've also revamped the ignoring system with this part of the update, which is now integrated better into the chat system. You will get better and more relevant feedback if you cannot message someone. You can now view your ignored players through a GUI also, through the ignore command or as a sub-menu of the friends GUI.

Here's a video showcase of what we just described:

## 🏗️ Game Builder

The MC Brawls Game Builder is the perfect tool for event-runners! You will be able to build custom game instances, with settings for each game type and the ability to pull in parties and set teams. The Game Builder will be available for all game types.

## 🤝 Partners

The partnership application has been closed until further notice.

This is to rethink and re-evaluate the partnership system to improve it. Partnership eligibility will be a lot more strict upon its return, but the benefits of being a partner will grow.

If you currently have a partner application open, it will be reviewed. Don't worry!

Happy Brawling! ⚔️
